## User Guide

#### Quality of Life

- By default, there are 19 Easy Access buttons on the home screen to log Food with a single click. You can long-press a button to go directly to this Food's edit page where you can disable its Easy Access switch if so desired. To add new buttons, click a Food in the Database and turn on the switch.
- On any Food's edit page, you can add set Custom Quickselect Weights (e.g., "55:1 Scoop-110:2 Scoops"). These appear below the Standard Quickselect Weights, taking up two columns.
- You can repeatedly press the "Day" button in the navigation bar to toggle between the "add" and "edit" pages.
- In the "Add Food" page, the "Enter" key on the keyboard is replaced by a "Next" key to jump to the next text field, except on the final text field where it becomes a "Checkmark" key to instantly save instead.
- When creating a Recipe, you can leave the "Overall Weight" field empty to automatically use the calculated sum of all ingredient weights. This can be useful for things like sandwiches where no extra water weight is added.
- The default Database includes an "Average" Food that is set to exactly 100kcal per 100g while maintaining a healthy balance of nutrients. If I estimate based on experience that a meal was roughly 700kcal, I simply log 700g of "Average" and call it good enough.

#### Health Connect

- If Health Connect Auto-Sync is active, every added, changed or deleted single Archive Entry will be instantly mirrored in Health Connect. Bulk changes (Import Archive, Clear Archive) do not automatically trigger syncs and must be synced manually via "Health Connect Full Manual Sync" if so desired. To be able to keep track of when something is happening in Health Connect, every write action is accompanied by a toast notification (e.g., "Archive Entry added to Health Connect"). This notifications can be disabled in options.
-  Health Connect has an unspecific yet strict limit on how many entries an app is allowed to create per second/minute/day/insertguess. The app attempts to max out that limit, and if a write attempt is rejected it tries again after a couple seconds until the attempt goes through. For my personal 3 year archive, this probably took 15 minutes easily. No idea if there are better solutions, but it works, and you typically do a big sync only once (since otherwise the Auto-Sync has got your back) so I guess it's good enough.
- I tried to implement an option where you can import your data FROM Health Connect INTO Minimalist Calorie Counter, but due to Play Store Review team having a massive stick up their ass when it comes to permissions, this didn't work out.
- Health Connect is by default local-only, but to protect against data loss, if you search for "Health Connect" in your phone settings, then click "Manage Data" and "Backup and restore", you can set a daily, weekly or monthly upload to Google Drive.

#### Tinkering

- If desired, it is possible to set your Database in a different language than the app UI. Set the app to your desired Database language, reset the Database, and then switch the app back to your preferred UI language.
- There is no option in the app for that, but if you want to completely clear out the Database, you can import [database_empty.csv](https://github.com/Makstuff/MinimalistCalorieCounter/blob/9da0ef3786e6f7f54b71d335681c2f8e5c225166/database_empty.csv).
- In case you end up manually editing the database CSV file, ensure it follows the [default format](https://github.com/Makstuff/MinimalistCalorieCounter/tree/3cd6049b0cee640e6fdbafbaff69f8ea3e6b145c/app/src/main/res/raw) and especially avoid illegal symbols like the classic culprits ";|,. Due to my lack of motivation as well as coding skill, the error messages of CSV import function are not particularly useful, so finding small errors like a comma in "3,5% whole milk" can be quite tricky.

## About this app

After testing many calorie counter apps without finding a perfect fit, I finally decided to take matters into my own hand and learn how to code for Android myself. This app is the final result of my efforts.

It is optimized for a minimum number of clicks in the long-term, for which it sacrifices significant intuitivity and ease of use in the short-term. First and foremost, it does not use a large external Database, as I prefer to verify all nutritional data directly from product labels or trusted sources like my nutrition table book. The interface is also structured in a way that makes for a steeper learning curve than most comparable apps, but once you get the hang of it and have customized Easy Access Foods and Quickselect Weight buttons to your liking, the speed of logging becomes incredible.
 
The early versions of this app until about version code 3 were coded 100% manually. For more complicated stuff I added later, like Health Connect support and the French, Italian, and Spanish translations, I however did massively rely on Gemini. Since for my skill level these things were pretty much impossible to do on my own, I am just glad I could get them done at all. By the way, if you find nonsensical translations in your language, please let me know.

Another detail is that during the initial development I was not aware of how weird USA and Canada's food labels are with their arbitrary "portions" and including fiber in carbohydrate. So the app is incompatible with this type of labels, and fixing this would be a major headache even with Gemini, so I decided to just exclude USA and Canada from the target regions in the Play Store. If you think your country should be excluded as well, please also let me know.
